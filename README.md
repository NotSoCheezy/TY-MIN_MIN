# Ty the Tasmanian Tiger - Min Min Revealed
The first Earth opal level, now available to the public after 20 years!

To use this mod, first install ty-mod-manager here: https://github.com/Dnawrkshp/ty-1-tools. Then, drag the files into your Mods folder and activate the mod in the mod loader.

Try to find all the earth opals, bilbies, and golden cogs! I actually haven't tried yet.

Special thanks to Koushi's rkvMT, Dnawrkshp's ty-1-tools, and Hidden Palace's Project Deluge! Without you, this would not have been possible!
